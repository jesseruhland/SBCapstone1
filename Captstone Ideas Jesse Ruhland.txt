Idea #1
Philadelphia Crime Data


Purpose:  Provide data related to crimes committed in the city of Philadelphia in a way that is easy to understand and obtain.


API: 
* https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/crime-incidents/resource/8beb3e4b-b62f-4237-840e-4276c7d7ae97
* https://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/carto-api-explorer/#incidents_part1_part2
* https://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/carto-api-explorer/#shootings (shootings specifically - has a lot more specific information to work with)


Description:  My idea here is to create an app that allows users to input filter criteria (like a date range, incident type, etc.) and return a list of results.  From that list, users should be able to click on an incident and get more details (for example, a map of the location).  I would like to provide a way to display graphical representations based on the returned data as well (although I’m not sure about the specifics of this yet, I’m assuming the response will be turned into a local database and information will be processed locally).




Idea #2
Recreation App


Purpose:  Provide data related to recreation activities and locations.


API:
* https://ridb.recreation.gov/docs#/


Description:  Recreation.gov offers a robust dataset that would allow me to create an application to find recreation activities, find recreation areas, or recreation facilities.  A user would be able to search for any of the categories and return relevant results.  They’re all cross referenced, so I feel like it would allow for several different “click for more details” opportunities in the app.  I am thinking “nearby” options could be listed on several pages as a suggestion.  




Idea #3
NYC Safer-Sex Mapper


Purpose:  Provide data related to the location and availability of free safer-sex products within the 5 boroughs of NYC.


API
* https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/4kpn-sezh


Description:  This app would be very similar to the first idea here (Philadelphia Crime Data).  A user would be able to show locations based on input criteria, click into a location for more details (for example a map, open hours, available products, etc.).  This could also recommend other nearby locations based on some location criteria.
